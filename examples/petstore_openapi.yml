        Creates multiple user accounts in a single operation by providing a list of user objects. This is functionally identical to createWithArray.
        
        Usage: Use this endpoint for bulk user creation. Provide a JSON array of complete user objects.
        
        Example: Send a POST with JSON body containing a list of user objects with all required and optional fields populated.
      operationId: createUsersWithListInput
      requestBody:
        $ref: '#/components/requestBodies/UserArray'
      responses:
        default:
          description: Successful operation - All users in the list created successfully

        Authenticates a user and creates a session. Returns authentication tokens and session information.
        
        Usage: Use this endpoint to authenticate users before they can perform authenticated operations. The username and password are sent as query parameters.
        
        Example: To log in user "johndoe" with password "mypassword", call GET /user/login?username=johndoe&password=mypassword. The response includes session tokens in headers.
        
        Security Note: In production, this should use POST with encrypted body rather than GET with query parameters.

        Example: Call GET /user/logout with the current session's authentication credentials to terminate the session.
